# Reservation App WordPress theme

This project implements a custom theme for CMS WordPress, which includes:
- Custom Post Types that display individual parts of the site such as rental houses, reviews or slides for the slider on the main page.
- Custom Fields Types are developed using the Advanced Custom Fields plugin, which provides the ability to specify the parameters of buildings and store the rating from reviewers in a separate field.
- Templates for page elements, such as a house card, or a review card.
